[R](https://www.r-project.org/) code for the analysis supporting [this January 31, 2017 BuzzFeed News article](https://www.buzzfeed.com/peteraldhous/immigration-and-science) on the importance of immigration into the US for science, based on an analysis of living Nobel prizewinners. Supporting files are in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/2017-01-immigration-and-science).

## Data preparation
The following code loads and processes data from the [Nobelprize.org API](https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_organizations/nobelmedia/nobelprize_org/developer/). It creates the following fields:

 *  `bornCountry2` This captures the current country for the laureate's place of birth. For example, it would make Ukraine the birth country of a scientist born within that nation's current borders during the Soviet era.
 * `us` Whether or not the scientist was at a US institution when the prize was awarded.
 * `born_us` Whether or not the scientist was born in the US.
 * `instance` Uniquely identifies each laureate/prize combination.

## Most living Nobel laureates were based in the US when they won their prizes

This code filters for living laureates and draws a waffle chart of laureates for the Physics, Medicine, Chemistry and Economics prizes, showing whether they were based in the US or elsewhere. One square represents one laureate.

## But of those US-based Nobel laureates, many were born in other countries

## Here's where those immigrant Nobelists were born

This code filters for living laureates who were based in the US at the time the prize was awarded but were born in other countries, and draws a bar chart showing the numbers by country of origin.

```{r,warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.show="hide"}

living_us_foreign <- living_us %>%
  filter(bornCountry != "USA") %>%
  group_by(bornCountry2) %>%

living_us_foreign$bornCountry2 <- gsub("United Kingdom", "UK", living_us_foreign$bornCountry2)
living_us_foreign$bornCountry2 <- gsub("the Netherlands", "Netherlands", living_us_foreign$bornCountry2)

# bar chart
ggplot(living_us_foreign, aes(x=reorder(bornCountry2,count), y=count)) +
